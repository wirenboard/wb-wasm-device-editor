"""A simulated DALI bus: control gear and control devices that answer real frames.

The gear and device models come from python-dali's own test fakes
(``dali.tests.fakes``), which implement the parts of IEC 62386 that matter here:
the commissioning state machine (INITIALISE / RANDOMISE / COMPARE / WITHDRAW /
PROGRAM SHORT ADDRESS), DTR handling, memory banks, and the DT8 colour
extensions. Driving those from raw frames — instead of from decoded commands, as
python-dali's own ``Bus`` does — is what lets the unmodified wb-mqtt-dali stack
run on top: everything from frame encoding upwards is production code.

The bus is deliberately synchronous. Delay modelling belongs to the gateway
above it, which is where the real timing constraints (queue depth, response
timeout) live.
