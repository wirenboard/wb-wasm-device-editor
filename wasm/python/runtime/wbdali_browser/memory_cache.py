"""A memo of DALI memory-bank bytes, so identity is read off the bus once.

Every device page open and every device initialization begins with the same
reads: memory bank 0 (GTIN, serial, firmware and hardware versions) and bank 1
(OEM data) — dozens of `ReadMemoryLocation` frames per device at ~46 ms each,
answering questions whose answers cannot change. The daemon reads them through
one generator, `read_memory_bank`, which the browser driver executes batch by
batch: `DTR1(bank)`, `DTR0(offset)`, then `ReadMemoryLocation` × n.

This memo sits in the driver and shadows the bus's DTR registers from the
commands passing through, so it knows which (bank, offset) each read targets.
A batch whose reads it can all answer never reaches the wire; the DTR writes
still do, so the real registers stay exactly where the daemon believes they
are, and a batch with a single miss goes out whole — never a mix of remembered
and real bytes.

Trust: a memo entry restored from a previous session is keyed by the random
address the device had then, and is only used after the device at that short
address has answered QUERY RANDOM ADDRESS with the same value — three frames,
against the fifty-odd they replace. A recommissioning command (INITIALISE,
RANDOMISE, PROGRAM SHORT ADDRESS) passing through drops the memo for that
bus, since short addresses are about to change hands.
